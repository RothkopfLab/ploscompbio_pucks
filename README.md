Neupärtl N, Tatai F, Rothkopf CA (2020) Intuitive physical reasoning about objects’ masses transfers to a visuomotor decision task consistent with Newtonian physics. PLOS Computational Biology 16(10): e1007730. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007730

It contains data of the corresponding visuomotor task and explanation of each measured variable:

- Trial: 	trial number specific for each subject in each phase starting at 1. In phase 2 common
	 	iterator for both pucks present, alternating all 4 trials.

- Subject:	anonymous participant code.

- StartPos.:	uniformly drawn starting position of the puck in range of 0-4 meters from zero point 
		and 1-5 meters from target's bullseye.

- EndPos.:	halt position of puck after being propelled.

- DistToTar.:	initial distance to target.

- DistMoved:	actually propelled distance.

- PressTime:	participant's press duration.

- AbsError:	absolute error in missing the target's bullseye.

- Error:	error in missing the target's bullseye.

- Condition:	condition stating the type of experiment participants were in: 1) Light-to-Heavy &
		2) Heavy-to-Light (order of puck's mass magnitudes by their appearance)

- Phase:	phase of the experiment: 1) prior phase 2) feedback 3) no-feedback 4) no-feedback
		after watching collisions

- Puck:		texture of the puck

- Mass:		puck's mass
