# Data: Newtonian visuomotor task

(Paper doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.14.949164)

Complete data set from the puck shooting experiment in 'Intuitive physical reasoning about objectsâ€™ masses 
transfers to a visuomotor decision task consistent with Newtonian physics'.

# Column entries

	- Trial: 	trial number specific for each subject in each phase starting at 1. In phase 2 common
		 	iterator for both pucks present, alternating all 4 trials.

	- Subject:	anonymous participant code.

	- StartPos.:	uniformly drawn starting position of the puck in range of 0-4 meters from zero point 
			and 1-5 meters from target's bullseye.

	- EndPos.:	halt position of puck after being propelled.

	- DistToTar.:	initial distance to target.

	- DistMoved:	actually propelled distance.

	- PressTime:	participant's press duration.

	- AbsError:	absolute error in missing the target's bullseye.

	- Error:	error in missing the target's bullseye.

	- Condition:	condition stating the type of experiment participants were in: 1) Light-to-Heavy &
			2) Heavy-to-Light (order of puck's mass magnitudes by their appearance)

	- Phase:	phase of the experiment: 1) prior phase 2) feedback 3) no-feedback 4) no-feedback
			after watching collisions

	- Puck:		texture of the puck

	- Mass:		puck's mass
